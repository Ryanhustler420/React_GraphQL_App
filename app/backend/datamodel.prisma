# check console with prisma console in command line

# this graphql file is for prisma aka backend
# anytime you make changes to datamodal.prisma . make sure you eploy to prisma server or else it won't work at all

# Errors:

# User
#   Ã— You are creating a required field but there are already nodes present that would violate that constraint.

# if you get this error anytime just open prisma console and jus clear existing data of that modal
# or you can pass --force flag but, i won't recommand you to do that command
